Simple Search Engines

Part-1: Graph structure-based search engine, you need to create a graph structure that represents a hyperlink structure of given collection of "web pages" and for each page (node in your graph) calculate PageRank and other graph properties. You need to create "inverted index" that provides a list of pages for every word in a given collection of pages. Your graph-structure based search engine will use this inverted index to find pages where query term(s) appear and rank these pages using their PageRank values.

Part-2: Content-based search engine, you need to calculate tf-idf values for each query term in a page, and rank pages based on the summation of tf-idf values for all query terms. Use "inverted index" you created in Part-1 to locate matching pages for query terms.

Part-3: Hybrid search engine, you need to combine both PageRank and tf-idf values in order to rank pages. More on this later ...
